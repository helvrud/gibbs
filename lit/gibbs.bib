@article{Jin2007,
	abstract = {Polymers are remarkable molecules that have relaxation times that can span 15 orders of magnitude. The very longest of the relaxation times for high molecular weight polymers are sufficiently long to overlap with fluid mechanical times scales; under those circumstances, polymers can influence the flow. A well-known example that is still not fully understood is polymer drag reduction. It has been known since Toms (1949 Proc. 1st Int. Congress on Rheology 2 135-41) that parts per million (mass basis) concentrations of polymers can reduce the drag on a solid surface by as much as 80{\%}. Understanding the mechanism of drag reduction requires an understanding of the dynamics of the dissolved polymer chain in response to local fluctuations in the turbulent flow field. We investigate this by using Brownian dynamics simulations of bead-spring models of polymers immersed in a turbulent solvent that is separately computed using direct numerical simulations. We observe that polymer chains with parameters that are effective for drag reduction generally remain stretched for long periods of time and only occasionally relax. The relatively restricted configuration space they sample makes it reasonable to represent their behavior with simpler dumbbell models. We also study the spatial structure of the polymer stresses using a Lagrangian strategy. The results explain the need for relatively high spatial resolution for numerical simulations of polymer flows. {\textcopyright}IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

	abstract = {We developed a new method for coarse-grained simulations of acid-base equilibria in a system coupled to a reservoir at a given pH and concentration of added salt, that we term the Grand-reaction method. More generally, it can be used for simulations of any reactive system coupled to a reservoir of a known composition. Conceptually, it can be regarded as an extension of the reaction ensemble, combining explicit simulations of reactions within the system and Grand-canonical exchange of particles with the reservoir. To demonstrate its strength, we applied our method to a solution of weak polyelectrolytes in equilibrium with a reservoir. Our results show that the ionization and swelling of a weak polyelectrolyte are affected by the Donnan effect due to the partitioning of ions and by the polyelectrolyte effect due to electrostatic repulsion along the chain. Both effects lead to a similar shift in ionization and swelling as a function of pH, albeit for different physical reasons. By comparison with published results, we showed that neglecting one or the other effect may lead to erroneous predictions or misinterpretations of results. In contrast, the Grand-reaction method accounts for both effects on the results and allows us to quantify them. Finally, we outline possible extensions and generalizations of the method and provide a set of guidelines for its safe application by a broad community of users.},

   abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) is one of the evolving membrane technologies in desalination with recent expanded new interest as a low energy process. The most significant parts of FO process are the membrane and draw solution since both play a substantial role in its performance. Hence, the selection of an appropriate membrane and draw solution is crucial for the process efficiency. Improvements in the development of membranes and draw solutes have been recorded recently. However, limitations such as fouling of FO membranes, reverse solute flux, concentration polarization, and low permeate flux in standalone FO systems. This work targets the review of recent progress in FO, aiming on the prospects and challenges. It starts with addressing the advantages of the FO process. The crucial part of this review is a thorough discussion of hybrid FO systems, different FO membranes, and draw solutes available coupled with their effects on FO performance. Finally, the future of FO for sustainable desalination is also discussed.},

   abstract = {Despite the impressive progress in forward osmosis (FO) membranes and pilot scale testing of FO process, lack of draw solutes that can be efficiently regenerated is still a limiting factor for more prolific commercial applications of FO technology. In the past decade, a large variety of draw solutes have been investigated. While many promising concepts were discussed, efforts are still needed to search for an 'ideal' draw solute which could enable the next breakthrough in FO technology. Besides giving a critical review on the development of FO draw solutes, we attempt to clarify some of the most important issues about draw solutes, to define the criterion for draw solutes, and to offer insights into challenges and opportunities concerning their future development. We intentionally avoid very detailed discussion on the issue of viability of FO, which was covered in several earlier reviews. Draw solutes are categorized into either non-responsive or responsive type according to their response toward external stimuli, such as heat and electromagnetic field. While the focus is on responsive draw solutes whose regeneration relies on their smart response to stimuli, non-responsive draw solutes are also discussed not only for a historic reason, but also for the valuable lessons learnt from these earlier systematic studies.},

In this paper arguments are presented that strongly favor the conventional definition of entropy and its resolution of Gibbs paradox.},

ABSTRACT = {In many nations, particularly those experiencing water scarcity, novel approaches are being applied to clean wastewater. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is the most widely used of these approaches because it entails the decomposition of organic molecules into water and carbon dioxide, which is a more ecologically benign process. In our study, we studied the photocatalytic degradation process on the effluent flumequine. This treatment is made through a solar pilot reactor in the presence of immobilized titanium dioxide with three light intensities and two types of water as solvents. A variety of factors that might influence the rate of deterioration, such as flow rate, light intensity, and initial concentration, have been investigated. The maximal degradation of flumequine was achieved at more than 90% after 2.5 h under optimal conditions (an initial concentration of 5 mg/L, three lamp light intensities, and a flow rate of 29 L/h). By combining the oxidized agent H2O2 with this process, the photocatalytic activity was improved further to 97% under the same conditions. The mineralization of this product has also been tested using total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. A high mineralization rate has been recorded at around 50% for a high initial concentration (20 mg/L) at a flow rate of 126 L/h. The results demonstrated the highly effective removal of flumequine and the efficacy of this photocatalytic system.},

ABSTRACT = {Photocatalysis has been widely studied for environmental applications and water treatment as one of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Among semiconductors that have been employed as catalysts in photocatalytic applications, bismuth sillenite crystals have gained a great deal of interest in recent years due to their exceptional characteristics, and to date, several sillenite material systems have been developed and their applications in photoactivity are under study. In this review paper, recent studies on the use of Bi-based sillenites for water treatment have been compiled and discussed. This review also describes the properties of Bi-based sillenite crystals and their advantages in the photocatalytic process. Various strategies used to improve photocatalytic performance are also reviewed and discussed, focusing on the specific advantages and challenges presented by sillenite-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, a critical point of certain bismuth catalysts in the literature that were found to be different from that reported and correspond to the sillenite form has also been reviewed. The effectiveness of some sillenites for environmental applications has been compared, and it has demonstrated that the activity of sillenites varies depending on the metal from which they were produced. Based on the reviewed literature, this review summarizes the current status of work with binary sillenite and provides useful insights for its future development, and it can be suggested that Bismuth sillenite crystals can be promising photocatalysts for water treatment, especially for degrading and reducing organic and inorganic contaminants. Our final review focus will emphasize the prospects and challenges of using those photocatalysts for environmental remediation and renewable energy applications.},
